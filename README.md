# PyBer_Analysis

### Overview of the analysis

The purpose of the analysis is to help PyBer with understanding the key metrics for the ride-sharing data by city type from Jan. 2019 to Apr. 2019 by creating DataFrames and to visualize the weekly fares total for each city type by using matplotlib. 

### Results

The dataframe is showing the results of the total rides, total drivers, total fares by city type. We noticed that urban city has the most demand for rides and with the demand, most drivers are choosing to drive around urban area and it also generates the most fares. The average fare per ride and average fare per driver is the lowest at urban city and highest at rural area.

The Total fare is grouped by city type including Rural,Subarban and Urban.The total fare in Urban cities is the highest and Suburban ranked in the middle. Rural has the lowest fare amount. The trend line is showing peaks at the end of Feb for all city types. The fare total seems to fluctuate the most in urban city.


### Summary
Based on the results, provide three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types.

  -  Focus on urban ride share analysis as 63% of the total fares is generated from urban cities. Analyze the reason behind the fluctuation and develop rider incentives for low seasons.
  -  Understand the rural resident's motivation to use PyBer service and survey the satisfaction level with PyBer services.
  -  For suburban cities, giving discounted rides during rush hours to encourage people to use the ride-sharing servies to increase total fares amount.
